1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.


Start 
Input YEAR
if (year % 4 && year % 100)
	if (year % 400)
		output " Leap year "
	output "Not Leap year"
Stop. 


2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.


Start 
Input a, b
c = a + b
Output c
Stop


3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.


Start
Input num
i=0
while  i<=10
	Output c = i * num
	i = i + 1
End while
Stop


4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.


Start
Input x, y
a = x, b = y
while (b!=0)
	t = b
	b = a % b
	a = t
End while
gcd = a
lcm = (x * y)/gcd
Output gcd, lcm
Stop

5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.


Start
sum = 0
Input a
while (a!=x)
	sum = sum + a
End while
Output sum
Stop
